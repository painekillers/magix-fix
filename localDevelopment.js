// THIS IS FOR LOCALLY MODIFYING MAGIX AND SHOULD NOT BE CHANGED WHEN PLAYING NORMALLY.
// If you wish to force Magix to use your local files (magix.js and magixUtils.js), set the value below to true. This is not advised because normally, the game will automatically use the newest version when possible and use your browser's local storage to keep an offline copy of the scripts. You should only use this if you are trying to modify Magix!
