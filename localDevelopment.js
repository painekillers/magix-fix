// THIS IS FOR LOCALLY MODIFYING MAGIX AND SHOULD NOT BE CHANGED WHEN PLAYING NORMALLY.
// If you wish to force Magix to use your local files (magix.js and magixUtils.js), set the value below to true. This is not advised because the game will automatically use the newest version when possible and use localStorage to store your mod files. You should only use this if you are trying to modify Magix.
