# Introducing the Magix fixer
Magix is a mod developed by pelletstarPL for NeverEnding Legacy, a game made by Orteil (open [here](https://orteil.dashnet.org/legacy/)). You can follow the instructions below on how to fix Magix.
## IF YOU ALREADY HAVE MAGIX INSTALLED (if you don't, look at the section below)
Paste in the following script into the console:
```js
javascript:localStorage.setItem("legacySave-alpha",btoa(encodeURIComponent(decodeURIComponent(atob(localStorage.getItem("legacySave-alpha"))).replace("Xbm-ilapeDSxWf1b/MagixOfficialR55B.js","ZmatEHzFI2_QBuAF/magix.js")))),location.reload()
```
It's that easy! If you can't open the console for some reason, you can try selecting all the code above and dragging it to your bookmark bar. Then, go to the tab with NeverEnding Legacy and click on the bookmark. You can then delete it.
