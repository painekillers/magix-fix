# Introducing the Magix fixer
Follow the instructions below on how to fix Magix.
## IF YOU ALREADY HAVE MAGIX INSTALLED (if you don't, look at the section below)
Paste in the following script into the console:
```js
var stuff = localStorage.getItem("legacySave-alpha")
localStorage.setItem("legacySave-alpha",btoa(encodeURIComponent(decodeURIComponent(atob(stuff)).replace("Xbm-ilapeDSxWf1b/MagixOfficialR55B.js","ZmatEHzFI2_QBuAF/magix.js"))))
location.reload()
```
It's that easy!
