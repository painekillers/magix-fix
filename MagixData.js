Let's go: Konrad Wallenrod is an 1828 narrative poem, in Polish, by Adam Mickiewicz, set in the 14th-century Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Mickiewicz wrote it, while living in St. Petersburg, Russia, in protest against the late-18th-century partitioning of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth by the Russian Empire, the Kingdom of Prussia, and the Habsburg Monarchy. Mickiewicz had been exiled to St. Petersburg for his participation in the Philomaths organization at Vilnius University. The poem helped inspire the Polish November 1830 Uprising against Russian rule. Though its subversive theme was apparent to most readers, the poem escaped censorship due to conflicts among the censors and, in the second edition, a prefatory homage to Tsar Nicholas I. Though Mickiewicz later disparaged the work, its cultural influence in Poland persists.<br>Anyway, how's your day been?</small>","icon":[12,12,"magixmod"],"type":"tech","cost":{"insight":325},"category":"tier1","startWith":0,"tier":1250,"req":{"papercrafting":true},"precededBy":["papercrafting"],"leadsTo":["noting","bookwriting"],"mod":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plasma4/magix-fix/master/magix.js","id":114},{"name":"noting","displayName":"Noting","desc":"[population,People] can now write notes to preseve and remember things and tasks! //<small>note 48255</small>","icon":[21,6,"magixmod"],"type":"tech","cost":{"insight":300},"category":"tier1","startWith":0,"tier":9531,"req":{"bookcrafting":true,"ink crafting":true},"precededBy":["bookcrafting","ink crafting"],"mod":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plasma4/magix-fix/master/magix.js","id":115},{"name":"bookwriting","displayName":"Bookwriting","desc":"[florist's notes] and [poet's notes] may now be written into a book. @unlocks the [lodge of writers], who will convert their notes into books","icon":[12,13,"magixmod"],"type":"tech","cost":{"insight":300},"category":"tier1","startWith":0,"tier":9531,"req":{"bookcrafting":true,"ink crafting":true},"precededBy":["bookcrafting","ink crafting"],"mod":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plasma4/magix-fix/master/magix.js","id":116},{"name":"better influence & authority","displayName":"Better influence & authority","desc":"Unlocks the [lawyer] and [mediator] units.
